## Description
### Motivation to create this App was to create wide use blog WebApp based on MVC
### I built this App because it had some new coding challanges needed to be solved. For me, as for a begginer, it was importent to get a new skills and got understanding that "I can do it!".
### This App helps with 
- save important info you want to have access any time;
- share this info with others;
- discuss ideas
  
### This project was interesting and usefull for me because, as a begginer, I learned how:
- learn MVC;
- learn handlebars;
- how to operate in between frony end and back end (pass the data);
- how sessions works.
